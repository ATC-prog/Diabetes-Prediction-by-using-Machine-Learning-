🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals by analyzing key medical attributes through machine learning techniques. The model aims to support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare decisions.

📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable machine learning model that evaluates health-related data and predicts whether a person is at risk of diabetes. By leveraging historical medical data, the system helps identify patterns that may indicate the presence of diabetes at an early stage.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of several medical and demographic features, including:

Number of pregnancies

Glucose level

Blood pressure

Skin thickness

Insulin level

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

These features are commonly used in clinical analysis and play a crucial role in diabetes prediction.

🛠 Technologies & Tools

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical computations

Scikit-learn – model building and evaluation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

🧠 Machine Learning Models Implemented

The following models were trained and evaluated to compare performance:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model was assessed to determine its effectiveness in predicting diabetes based on the given features.
